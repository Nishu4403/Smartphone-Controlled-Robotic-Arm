# Smartphone-Controlled-Robotic-Arm
In this project, I have built a Robot Arm using Arduino, which can be wirelessly controlled by a smartphone app via bluetooth

The Robotic Arm is an embedded system. This system uses the Arduino board for controlling the robot arm and depends on the inputs given by the user. The user will give the commands using the Android application. The Android application sends the commands to the robot arm wirelessly using Bluetooth technology.
